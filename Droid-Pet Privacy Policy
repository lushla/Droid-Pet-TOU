Droid-Pet may collect and securely store select user data to facilitate its features. This includes your unique Discord user ID, the ID of the server on which you interact with the bot, and the specific commands you utilize. This data is processed for the purpose of personalizing your experience, managing features, and optimizing the bot's functionality.

1.1 Command Usage Tracking
To ensure the safety of the community and aid in troubleshooting potential issues, the bot will record details of command usage, including the command itself, the user who initiated it, and the server context. This information assists in tracking and addressing any illicit activities and identifying development bugs that may arise.

Your data is treated with utmost confidentiality. Only select developers, who require access to maintain and improve the bot, have limited access to certain data, which is primarily limited to user IDs, server IDs, and tags.
