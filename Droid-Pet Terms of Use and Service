Droid-Pet Terms of Use and Service
1. Introduction
Welcome to Droid-Pet, your versatile companion bot designed for the Growtopia community and general server management. By utilizing the Droid-Pet bot, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to these terms and conditions. These terms, in conjunction with Discord's Terms of Service (TOS) and Terms of Use (TOU), and Growtopia's Growtopian code and the game's general rules and regulations, constitute the binding agreement governing your interaction with the Droid-Pet bot.

2. Compliance with TOS and TOU
By engaging with Droid-Pet, you commit to uphold both Discord's and Growtopia's Terms of Service and Terms of Use. You undertake not to engage in activities that violate these terms, encompass harmful behavior, abuse, or any form of illegal conduct.

3. Server Eligibility and Strike Rule
Droid-Pet may only be employed within servers that adhere to both Discord's and Growtopia's TOS and TOU. While we understand that you may not have control over every action within your server, the bot will only be considered for removal if it is directly used to breach Growtopia's rules, such as using bot commands for casino activities or attempting to use public embed commands to create casino-like rules or any rules that violate Discord's TOS. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with these rules. Failure to adhere may result in a "strike." Accumulation of three strikes will lead to a permanent ban from utilizing Droid-Pet.

4. Ownership and Affiliation
All Growtopia sprites and assets are the property of Ubisoft and Growtopia Entertainment. Droid-Pet is not affiliated with or owned by Ubisoft in any way.

5. Database and Command Specifics
The bot's databases store data related to used commands by users. Staff members are only granted access to specific databases to contribute information or useful emojis. They cannot access user information. Commands that add content to the bot's database each have their own dedicated staff members and databases. To view the bot's staff and their permissions, you can use the /botinfo command.

6. Copy Rights
The source code of Droid-Pet was never meant to be public. You are not allowed to clone any of our commands. Engaging in sharing a fake Droid-Pet or a Droid-Pet clone or trying to clone the code is against our TOS, and I personally do not grant any staff member or any user permission to clone the code, design, style, or any other sensitive/private information. You are not allowed to use the bot owner's name in any clone as it is considered impersonation/misinformation. Similarly, you are not allowed to clone the codes to use your name on it.

8. Changes and Updates
These terms are subject to updates to accommodate changes in our services or comply with legal requirements. Continued utilization of Droid-Pet implies your acceptance of any such revisions.
